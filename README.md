# ArduinoUsingRaspi
## Program Arduino using command line
First, the packages avr-gcc (package is usually called gcc-avr), avr-libc and avrdude need to be installed. On Debian-based systems (as raspian is) the command
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude
```
can be used to install the required packages.
